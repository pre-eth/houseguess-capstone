# HouseGuess

A simple Python 3 Tkinter GUI game where players see an image of a commercial building or place and try to guess its location.

## Features (MVP)
- Tkinter GUI
- Maps Data API integration via RapidAPI
- Random images per round
- Guess approximate radius of origin and get immediate feedback
- Score tracking (basic leaderboard)
- Extensible structure for distance-based scoring

## Quick Start (Linux / macOS)

This project requires Linux or macOS to run.

First, set up the `.env.example` template file with a valid API key for the [Maps Data](https://rapidapi.com/alexanderxbx/api/maps-data) API. Then, rename it to `.env`

Afterwards, paste the following into your terminal. Python 3.10 is recommended.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pre-eth/houseguess-capstone.git
cd houseguess-capstone
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m houseguess
```
